# Consumer-Credit-Risk
Estimating the chance that someone will not pay back their loan. Then I will take this information and decide whether to give them the loan or not. 

## Business Question
How do we decide which applicants to approve for credit while mitigating the default losses and maximizing our companies profit? 


## Project Overview
This project's purpose is to build a credit risk model to estimate the probability of default for loan applicants and uses that risk to make approval decisions that balance the profit in the loss from the loans. 


## Mock company 
This analysis is framed around a mock medium-sized consumer lending company that gives out personal loans. The company wants to grow revenue while controlling default losses.
